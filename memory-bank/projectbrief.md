# Project Brief - TCO Advanced V4

## Project Overview
**TCO Advanced V4** is a sophisticated web application for calculating and comparing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for industrial equipment with wear protection strategies. It provides Excel-style interface for maintenance strategy analysis.

## Core Purpose
- Calculate and compare multiple maintenance strategies for industrial equipment
- Analyze wear progression and cost accumulation over time
- Provide visual analytics and real-time calculations
- Enable data import/export for Excel compatibility

## Key Requirements
1. **Multi-Strategy Comparison**: Support unlimited maintenance strategies side-by-side
2. **Excel-Style Interface**: Familiar data entry with color-coded wear rates
3. **Real-Time Calculations**: Instant updates as parameters change
4. **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts for wear progression and cost analysis
5. **Data Management**: Import/Export strategies as JSON, duplication, persistence

## Technology Stack
- React 18.2.0 with TypeScript 5.0.2
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons

## Business Domain
Industrial equipment maintenance focusing on:
- Wear plate protection strategies
- Component replacement scheduling (Floor, Stage 0-4)
- Cost optimization over equipment lifecycle
- Maintenance intervention planning

## Success Criteria
- Accurate calculations matching Excel-based models
- Intuitive user experience for industrial engineers
- Reliable data persistence and export capabilities
- Clear visual representation of cost and wear trends
